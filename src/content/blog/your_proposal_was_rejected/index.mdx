After spending a lot of time writing a good abstract for your favorite
conference, you receive the bad news: your proposal was rejected.

It's highly probable that your head will start spinning on trying to find
explanation of why it was rejected, and requesting feedback on why
only got you some generic comment without much context to improve it.

Now what?

The worst decision you can make is to get angry, and decide to never send
a proposal again. It might be the easier and most logical solution for
a few seconds while being angry, but take a deep breath, it's not as bad
as you imagine.

During the last years, I have been speaking in many conferences, with talks,
lightning talks, even keynotes. In a few conferences where I submit my
proposals, I'm even one of the organizers, and I still get my proposals
rejected.
