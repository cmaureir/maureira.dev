Despite the honor and happiness of the result, I feel it was pure chance
considering the final vote count for all the candidates.  The three directors
that were finishing their periods decided to re-run for their seats, so I was
almost certain all of them would have been elected, but surprisingly I got
DÃ©bora's seat for **only 2 votes**. Yes, two-votes.

When we mention on social media, or other platforms that is **very important to
vote**, that's exactly what we mean. The top 3 positions had only a few votes
differences, and **YOUR vote** can really make the process completely
different.  I know many of you didn't vote, and independently of the reason,
I'd like to encourage you to go [to
psfmember.org](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=32)
and register yourself as a voting member, because I'm certain you do spend more
than 5 hours in Python-related projects, or communities.

This election has a lot of details from my point of view that I would like to
share:

# The Brazilian Community

It's highly probable that if you heard "Brazilian Python Community"
[DÃ©bora's](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/debora-azevedo/)
name will popup in your head. She has been a key leader in the Brazilian
community, and in my opinion, mainly with the large amount of PyLadies chapters
that Brazil has.

Getting DÃ©bora's seat means that I'm responsible, together with the rest of the
Board, to keep nurturing and helping the Brazilian community.

This is something I will do gladly, I had the luck of meeting many Brazilian
Pythonistas in the last years, I helped a bit chairing a couple of talks for
their Spanish track years ago in the Python Brasil conference, I have been in
touch with developers that also speak Spanish, and have been giving talks in
the Spanish track at PyConUS (PyCon Charlas), and last but not least, I have
been following DÃ©bora's work, and many other PyLadies from Brazil for a couple
of years.

Even though I cannot speak Portuguese, I can understand it a bit, so rest
assure I will be always one-call away from any question from the Brazilian
community.

Last but not least, the PSF Board is losing a PyLadies member, but my
compromise with PyLadies communities is hopefully enough to say that the PSF
Board is getting a PyLadies Ally.

# African representation

I was very lucky to be one of the co-organizers of the first PyLadies Global
Conference (PyLadiesCon), and that gave me the chance of indirectly knowing
[Abigail](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/abigail-dogbe/),
one of the keynotes of the conference.

Knowing the amount of work that the Python community has been doing in Africa
is very impressive, not only for her work, but for the many other people I have
been knowing ever since.

Through other people from African communities, I have been aware of the
difficulties they have been experiencing, so I really hope I could help by
listening to their problems, and will do my best to help.

I'm certain Abigail would have been a great board member, and I really hope she
can run in the next period.

# APAC will keep growing

One of my nominations this year was [KwonHan
Bae](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/kwonhan-bae/),
I knew he was on a special situation and with only one year in the board, he
deserved to be re-elected, so I'm really happy he managed to keep his seat.

The short time I have been interacting with him has been amazing, it's rare to
share a vision for the Python community, and in each interaction I had with
him, it seemed we were pushing for the same direction. I'm very happy to be
able to work with him towards improving the representation and support for the
APAC communities.

Please watch [his lightning
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54q_cPCNNS8&t=172s) at PyConUS 2023.

There are many other key members in the APAC community that have run in the
past and couldn't get elected, like Iqbal (check [his
thoughts](https://iqbalabdullah.net/posts/2024/07/the-psf-election-results-2024-what-i-think/)
on this elections) , but I know are supporting KwonHan Bae, and for sure will
help him more with a local perspective, even without being in the board.

# Not forgetting the technical bits

This year, [Filipe
LaÃ­ns](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/filipe-lains/)
decided to run for the board with a different perspective, and not only
focusing on the community aspects of the role, but also bringing to the
discussion the technical aspect of the Python Packaging story.

I agreed with all the goals Filipe shared about improving the user
experience, support the PyPA and Core Team, and engage with external
stakeholders. So I'm certain that Filipe's plans are something that
needs to be done, and with his help, we most probably will be able
to make progress on that front.

Even though most nominations are vocational and community based,
having a more technical approach is something I would like to have
more often.

# The Spanish-speaking community heavy backpack


ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡º ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡» ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¹ ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¶ ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡³ ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡® ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¾ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª

Many of you might think that the many Spanish-speaking Python initiatives
are related, but most of them are not, and the link between them, besides
the language, is that we are very open to **helping others**, that's
why you might associate the faces with the initiatives, because
we empower each other on a daily basis. And I believe that's key
for a PSF board of Directors.

We are a lucky community, we have **21 countries that oficially speak Spanish in the world**,
and we are distributed in three continents (America, Europe, and
[Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea)),
but we are still growing, and most of us (including myself) still believe
some times that we are not enough for making a big impact in world-wide
organizations. We don't have many PSF Fellows, we only have two
Core developers, and only a few successful Python modules that
you most probably know.

**In 2019, I was a nobody in the Python Community**, and I made the decision
of joining a local meetup in Berlin, to see if I could have found
more people sharing my interests. I decided to search for some communities
and had the chance of going to PyCon US 2019, where I discovered a large
Spanish-speaking community that was trying to make a stronger presence
in the Python Ecosystem. Since then I have been learning from many people
that have been longer than me in the community, and have been trying, and
trying to get more representation, help more people, and bring more people
to our beloved community.

I know I have the support from
[Lecovi](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/leandro-enrique-colombo-vina/)
and
[Ariel](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/ariel-silvio-norberto-ramos/)
from the Argentinian community, the oldest and maybe largest Spanish-speaking
South American community; also from
[Karo](https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/karo-ladino/)
in Colombia, a community with a blooming generation of new PyLadies Chapters and
people helping in their community and conference; but also from previous people
that tried to join the board, to be seen, and to be heard.

I'm carrying in my mind the efforts of the only [Python
Ambassador](https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2016-02-25/#new-business),
Manuel Kaufmann (Humitos),
that decided to grab a car and drive around South America creating
Python communities and organizing a lot of Python events
(See [Humitos' initiative here](https://argentinaenpython.com/));
I'm bringing the experience of the Python Spain community that welcomed me
and trusted me to help with their association and national conference even
when I was not Spanish, nor living in Spain;
I'm taking with me the reach of the EuroPython Society, and their vision
to work together alongside with the PSF.

# Final words

My seat in the board has a big responsibility that comes from a collective
efforts from many people.
I'm taking with me the newly formed communities from
South and Central America, the struggling communities that fall asleep, the PyLadies groups
that are alone in some countries without any larger communities that supports
them, the conferences that run with organizers budget, and the many people that
got tired of trying and trying to get in the board only to make us more
visible.

I'm taking with me all our conversations and plans for the future,
and I promise you I will do my best.
