Writing proposals for conferences and events **is not a simple task**.
Usually we believe that a *clickbaity* title can do us a favor,
or sometimes we believe because we are very related to a topic we can
give an excellent talk.

The issue is always that reviewers might not know you, in some cases
the reviews are anonymous, so you need to do a very good job of writing
an abstract that can "show the reviewers" you are capable of discussing
that topic, and that the talk is worth accepting.

Some people like to think that an abstract needs to be an **elevator pitch** of
your talk, so you need to provide a certain structure in order to be
a good proposal, which I completely agree with.

## Why I'm writing this

During the last years, I have been a reviewer and also in charge of the Program
team of many conferences, and I cannot emphasize how much you will gain by
having a well-structured abstract. Still by this day, I see proposals that are
1 or 2 phrases on a certain topic without context, nor problem definition,
so please take the time to write a good abstract.


<Callout title="Word of advise" variant="note">
Having a well-structured abstract doesn't guarantee you to get a talk
accepted, I get proposals rejected all the time, but I promise you it will help
you greatly.
</Callout>

## The 5 key points for a good abstract

For that, I'd like to share **five key aspects** that an abstract needs
to have in order to provide all the required information to reviewers,
and make you feel proud of your submission.

### 1. Give Context

Start your abstract by giving a bit of context, so people can understand the
main motivation.

It's a recurrent problem of proposals when the submitter assumes that reviewers
will know about everything they are referring in their proposal.

### 2. Define the problem or project

Readers will know the main objective you are trying to reach.

You had a special motivation before starting to write the your talk, share it
with the audience!

### 3. Describe why is important

Describe the importance of a solution for such problem/project.

In bold terms, why people should care about your talk? Even if it's a specific
field, you might encounter that error in other areas.

### 4. Share what will be discussed

Share a bit of the precise topics/examples/areas that will be discussed on your
talk, and maybe engage with the audience by telling them «what they will learn»
if they attend.

A typical paragraph that start with "On this talk, you will..." might work.

### 5. State what is needed for your talk

Let people know if they need to have some previous knowledge for attending your
talk.

This help readers but also reviewers, mainly to match the talk-level you
provided, with the audience that's expected.

And that's all!

### Extra point

In some conferences (PyConUS, EuroPython, etc) you are also
required to **write an outline** for your talk, and in most cases detail on the
time you will expect on each item is required as well.

For this, please avoid a simple outline like "Introduction, Main talk,
Conclusion", and instead detail the topics you will be talking (with
some description).

It's fine to give introductions to certain topics, but you
might want to add if the type of introduction, or the details you want to
highlight. The same with the content of the talk, maybe you want to discuss
implementation details of your project, and then provide a few live-examples,
add that information as well, and estimate a time per each item, so reviewers
can see how the total time of your talk will be distributed.

## Is that all?

Many conferences offer speaker mentorship programs, or even some feedback
rounds on the proposals, please take them! Even if you believe you have 10+
years experience in the field, your proposals might have holes in it, or you
might start from the base everyone in the review committee knows the background
of your topic.

Feedback is very useful, because it will teach you "what is conference
X looking for", and you might end up having different abstracts **tones**
depending on the conference you are applying to.

And like many other things, if your proposal get rejected, keep trying!
some times rejections are not a "your proposal is bad" but more like "we
decided to use another proposal because of X".
