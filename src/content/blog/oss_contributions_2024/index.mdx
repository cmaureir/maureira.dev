Following the tradition [I started in
2023](/posts/oss-contributions-in-2023.html), I kept track of all the community
contributions, participation, and collaborations of 2024 (monthly distribution
in the plot)

Compared to the 531.7 hours I spent during 2023, **I spent 650.4 hours in
2024**
which is a 22% increase.

[EuroPython](https://europython.eu) took most of my time, because I was in
charge of the Program committee, followed by
[PyLadiesCon](https://conference.pyladies.com) from which I was working in the
infra of the conference, including the website and the Discord server we added
this year and [the PSF](https://python.org/psf-landing) takes the 3rd place,
because I was elected to the board 🐍

Looking at the comparison with last year, you can check some of the highlights
in this plot. The most notorious change was stepping aside my contributions to
[Python Spain](https://es.python.org) after a few years, and how I have been
shifting my efforts toward EuroPython, PyLadiesCon, PyConUS and the PSF.

My message to you is to start tracking your contributions 🗒️ , you might have
no idea of the impact you are doing in some communities until you gather the
time you spend on them! ❤️

> Your couple of hours here and there, do make a difference, and you need to be
> proud of it! 🎉

...and please, if you spend at least 5 hours per month volunteering in
Python-related projects and initiatives, become a [PSF contributing member
here](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=32) 🐍

Is there something you believe is missing in some communities? do you need some
advise in how to start? let me know!
