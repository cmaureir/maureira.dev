During 2022, I noticed that many people were contributing to communities in
different ways, but most of them were not aware of the amount of time they
spent doing it...including myself. So I started to **log everything** I was doing
on a daily basis.

In 2023, **I spent 531.68 hours** in contributions to Python communities, which
include things like, reviewing PRs, designing logos/posters/websites, giving
talks, helping others, organizing conferences, automating processes, reviewing
proposals, moving chairs, etc.

Here you can see the amount of hours I spent per month:

and here you can see the amount of hours per project during 2023

I'm certain many of your also spent lots of time by helping initiatives, so
I encourage you also keep track üóíÔ∏è, to understand the impact you can do in
communities ‚ú®

During my 2024, my plan is to step down from a few initiatives, to spend more
time in others that I believe can have a higher impact on the community ü§©

Thanks to the many communities that allowed me to contribute to:
